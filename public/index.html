			<p>For example, you could support David Lemmy's proposal to put the EU Referendum to a parliamentary vote: <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/746728892279431168">https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/746728892279431168</a></p>

		Tweet this briefer version at your member of parliament:-
		<blockquote class="point">
			As one of your constituents may I ask you to do everything you can to not let Brexit happen.

		Or you could ask your MP to support <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/746728892279431168">David Lemmy's proposal to put the EU Referendum to a parliamentary vote</a>.
		<blockquote class="point">

	<h3 id="reasons">Why ‘undo Brexit’</h3>
	<ol>
		<li class="littlepoint">Many of the arguments of the leave campaign were based on things that were untrue and so many that voted to leave felt tricked and regret their decision.</li>
		<li class="littlepoint">The vast majority of young people who must face the consequences of this voted to remain or could not vote as, unlike, the Scottish independence vote, 16-17 year olds could not vote.  It isn't fair on them.</li>
		<li class="littlepoint">Many groups also greatly affected by the result were unfairly excluded from taking part, for example British people living abroad and Europeans living and working in the UK.
		<li class="littlepoint">We're scared about our futures and we don't know what else we can do.
	</ol>
